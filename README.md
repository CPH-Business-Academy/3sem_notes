## What is JavaScript? 

JavaScript is primarily a client-side language. JavaScript started at **Netscape**, a web browser developed in the 1990s. A webpage can contain embedded JavaScript, which executes when a user visits the page. The language was created to allow web developers to embed executable code on their webpages, so that they could make their webpages interactive, or perform simple tasks. Today, browser scripting remains the main use-case of JavaScript.

JavaScript is an **interpreted language**, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
